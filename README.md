Hello !

Here is my invites prediction for DotA 2 teams based on Elo Rating system.
Every rank follows these steps:
- I begin the ratings by the previous Valve tournament
- I initialize each team with the same points and then compute their Elo score with the game played
- For every lan which occured between the previous Valve tournament and the invite annoncement i introduce the new teams, a weight 
for the tournament and compute the scores
- At the end i compare the teams invited by Valve and mines
